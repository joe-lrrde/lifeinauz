        <h1>Poetry</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="intro">
        <p class="sentence">For as long as I can remember I have been writing. </p><br>
        <p class="sentence">Ironically I wrote not because I had an overflowing imagination but because I simply wanted
            to put words on paper. </p><br>
        <p class="sentence">So I would write the same stories over and over again. And the more I grew the less I was
            able to finish them. </p><br>
        <p class="sentence"> I think this is why I turned into poetry. It's harder to start a poem than it is finishing
            it. </p><br>
        <p class="sentence">Even if you write 3 lines, you can call it a poem. There are no rules to poetry. Because
            there are as many different
            types of poetry as there are writers. Poets. </p><br>
        <p class="sentence">I don't like that poetry is this art seen as copmlicated and untouchable. Don't get me
            wrong, I strongly believe that
            writing good poetry is one of the hardest things to do. But at the end of the day it just takes practice.
        </p><br>
        <p class="sentence">And what's more important is that you don't need to be a poet to enjoy poetry. Or rather,
            you're a poet even if you don't
            think you are. So read poetry. Don't shut the door to it. And if you don't like a poem, change poets. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="sentence">Because I guarantee you will find poetry to your taste. </p><br><br>
        <p class="sentence" id="point">Now to prove my point, write a poem with me : </p><br>

            This is a sneak peak to some of my poetry. It is geographically ordered because environment influences
            experiences
            and I write mostly from what I experience.
