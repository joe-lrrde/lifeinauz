I had in mind one of those interactive books that you usually get as a child. I didn't end up doing one as it was a little too time consuming and i could not figure out how to make it fun and interactive. I have not completely given up on the idea, though I am more turning towards the idea of making my own monthly 'zine'. This - and the next few images - are my brainstorming ideas for that book."

I also like the idea of having a little activity on the website and for it to be a journal that people can sign.

There is the possibility to make the pixels bigger or smaller and to erase what was done. My favourite feature is when the 'Éphémère' button is switched on, the pixels disappear over time."

                   <br>  Because one of the first thing I did with my friends here was to go on a weekend long roadtrip to Melbourne I though it would be fun to reflect that in the website. And I found one of the most important things in a roadtrip was the playlist, because they create the ambiance for the journey. I thought it would be fun to create an interactive playlist where everyone could add their own favourite songs.'
