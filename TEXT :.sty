Hi ! 
Welcome to my discovery?/adventure? website.
My name is Joe, I'm a French guy and I moved to Adelaide in July 2025. 
Let me show you around my life here.

I'll let you choose which way you want to go about it. 
I've got the chronological option for my type A brain gals, pals and gendy nootch frenz. 
I've got the thematic option for my type B frenz. 
aaaaaand for the most adventurous of you I have the random generator (click and see what happens). 

POETRY 
For as long as I can remember I have always been writing. 
Ironically I wrote not because I had an overflowing imagination but because I simply wanted to put words on paper. 
So I would write the same stories over and over again. And the more I grew the less I was able to finish them. 
I think this is why I turned into poetry. It's harder to start a poem than it is finishing it. 
Even if you write 3 lines, you can call it a poem. There are no rules to poetry. Because there are as many different 
types of poetry as there are writers. Poets. 
I don't like that poetry is this art seen as copmlicated and untouchable. Don't get me wrong, I strongly believe that 
writing good poetry is one of the hardest things to do. But at the end of the day it just takes practice. 
And what's more important is that you don't need to be a poet to enjoy poetry. Or rather, you're a poet even if you don't 
think you are. So read poetry. Don't shut the door to it. And if you don't like a poem, change poets. 
Because I guarantee you will find poetry to your taste. 

Now to prove my point, write a poem with me. 
[exercise]

See ! This is your poem. Now you can practice with this structure, but never forget, 
rules exist as long as they are useful. 
This structure is meant to be changed and played with.
